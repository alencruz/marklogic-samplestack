For example: Zorba provides such an API for PHP, and there is the XQuery API for Java etc.\n\nIf your XML data is stored in an XML database server that supports XQuery, then you would issue your XQuery queries to the server and get the results back. There are many open source and commercial products in this category. BaseX is an open source example.\n\n**Generating pages statically:**\n\nYou might wish to generate some of the HTML pages statically from XML data. In this case you can run a command line XQuery utility, for example Zorba, Saxon, BaseX and many others provide such CLI tools. Or you can also do it from your own scripts using an API.\n\nThen you would define rules in your build system to execute these commands or scripts whenever your XML data changes.\n\nIn both the static and dynamic approaches, you can set your environment so that XQuery plays along with your templating system, for example, instead of generating whole HTML pages by XQuery, you can generate HTML segments based on XML, and then plug them into your templates.\n\n**Uses other than transformations:**\n\nThe above cases are about transforming XML to HTML, but XQuery can be used in other ways in the web development process. One way I find it useful is to modify XML documents. Say you have a long XML document and you would like to modify field values or add fields or attributes - you can use the XQuery Update Facility extension to achieve that.\n\nHope this helps.
