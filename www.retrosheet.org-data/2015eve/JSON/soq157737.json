But if you are creating an UI more like a web application, where the user stays at a single page for a long time (think gmail, google calendar, etc) then it probably is better to look at [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/), [ExtJs](http://extjs.com), or [GWT](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/).", "upvotingContributorIds":["unknown", "unknown"], "creationDate":"2008-10-13T19:18:58.487Z", "itemTally":1, "downvotingContributorIds":["unknown"], "comments":[], "owner":{"userName":"souser27488@example.com", "displayName":"timmfin", "originalId":"27488", "id":"sou27488"}, "id":"soa198712"}, {"text":"It's already been mentioned, but I will say it again: jQuery.  The strength of jQuery is not just the ability to make a simple AJAX call or the great UI extension library.  In my humble opinion, the best part of jQuery is how you can easily handle the return data.  jQuery easily allows you to navigate XML just like you can HTML.  \n\nFor instance, say you get back an xml request:\n\n(: Borrowed this XML document from a MarkLogic training file :)\n\n\t<author name=\"Boynton\">\n\t  <book>\n\t    <title>Barnyard Dance!</title>\n\t    <year>1993</year>\n\t  </book>\n\t  <book>\n\t    <title>Hippos Go Berserk!</title>\n\t    <year>1996</year>\n\t  </book>\n\t</author>\n\t\n\njQuery can retrieve all the year elements with this simple command:\n\n\tvar years = $(\"year\");\n\t\n\t//Ok, lets act on each element instead\n\t\n\t$(\"year\").each(function(index, value){\n\t   alert(\"Element \" + index + \" = \" + value);\n\t});\n\t\n\t/* OUTPUT\n\t   Element 0 = 1993\n\t   Element 1 = 1996\n\t/*\n\t\n\nTry doing that in normal Javascript!\n\nFurthermore, the way jQuery is designed is simply beautiful.  The founders encourage extending the framework by adding the ability to create extensions into the core of the library (sure you can always just edit the Javascript file, but what happens when there's a critical update to the framework).\n\nAnother great reason to use jQuery is its compatibility with other Javascript frameworks.  By default both Prototype and jQuery use the \"$\" sign to refer to the main library object.  Only jQuery adds the functionality to remove this reference so it can coexist with Prototype.\n\njQuery makes JavaScript enjoyable.", "upvotingContributorIds":["unknown"], "creationDate":"2009-06-08T02:33:16.860Z", "itemTally":0, "downvotingContributorIds":["unknown"], "comments":[], "owner":{"userName":"souser118885@example.com", "displayName":"Richard Clayton", "originalId":"118885", "id":"sou118885"}, "id":"soa963263"}, {"text":"I'd go with ExtJS ([http://extjs.com/](http://extjs.com/)). \nIt has a very good component and event model and very good support. \nIt's AJAX at it's best ;)\n\nYou can use actions with a JSON response to provide data to the Ext frontend. You don't even need to mix you client frontend with the server frontend (via JSPX / tags).\n\nSome see the fact that you have to develop the client frontend separated from the server frontend as a disadvantage of Ext. I think that it's not, as I have switched web applications built with Ext from a java backend to a .Net backend without changing a line of client frontend code, be it HTML or Javascript.\n\nHave a look at the Ext examples and docs before you decide.", "upvotingContributorIds":["unknown"], "creationDate":"2008-10-01T14:18:58.297Z", "itemTally":0, "downvotingContributorIds":["unknown"], "comments":[], "owner":{"userName":"souser24022@example.com", "displayName":"Bogdan", "originalId":"24022", "id":"sou24022"}, "id":"soa157826"}, {"text":"Struts already come with [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/) framework.
